    Grokking Engineering is a Vietnam-based program that aims to promote
    technical discussions and sharing of advanced topics in software engineering
    and computer sciences. Example topics: databases, scalable infrastructure,
    data infrastructure, software engineering processes, web performance,
    concurrent programming, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    We'd like to invite the technical you to our program's kick-off event this
    early December, featuring 2 talks about data infrastructure and database
    indexes.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please find the event's details below and register. We hope to see you
    there!
    </p>

    <p>
    P/s: The event is conducted in both English and Vietnamese. The talks are in
    speakers' language of preference.

    For our first talk, we are glad to present talks by 2 developers from Ho Chi
    Minh City and Singapore:
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>The absolute minimum every software developer needs to know about database
      indexes</b><br>
    by <b>Cedric Chin</b> (Floating Cube Studios, Ho Chi Minh City)
    </p>
    <p>
    Language: English
    </p>

    <p>
    If you’re a software developer, it’s nearly guaranteed that you’ve worked
    with a database before. But what happens when you find your queries running
    slowly? How do you debug bad database performance? The truth is, most of us
    don’t know much about RDMS internals: we just insert and retrieve data and
    pray that our queries run quickly enough. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The good news? It turns out that the only thing a developer really needs to
    understand about relational databases is how their indexes work. Most of the
    performance characteristics of modern RDMSes may be explained through the
    database index. This talk introduces the data structures these indexes use,
    how these structures determine query performance, how to read a query plan,
    and what to think about when designing indexes for your database schema.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>How we built our data-warehouse and analytics infrastructure at Viki</b><br>
    by <b>Huy Nguyen</b> (Viki, Singapore)
    </p>
    <p>
    Language: English / Vietnamese
    </p>

    <p>
    At Viki we collect and analyze over 60M user-generated data points everyday.
    This talk goes into deep technical and architecture design to share about
    the infrastructure, the different tools and processes we’ve built with our
    analytics system. Specifically we’ll talk about how we collect, process data
    and present data in both real-time and batch-processing manners.
    </p>

    <p>
    The current system is capable of supporting a variety of business and
    product needs: automated business reporting, A/B testing, cohort analysis,
    funnel analysis, recommendation engine, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    Technology stack: Ruby, Python, R, NodeJS, Golang, PostgreSQL, Java, Storm,
    Hadoop with Apache Hive.
