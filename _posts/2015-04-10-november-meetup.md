We first started Grokking Engineering with the kick-off meetup on November, 2014 at Atlassian office in Ho Chi Minh. Many people turned up for 2 talks on database index and analytics infrastructure.

## Database index

Cedric from Floating Cubes studios came and showed us how database indexes are actually implemented. That was an interesting talk since almost everyone knows what indexes are supposed to do, but we rarely think about what kind of data-structure and algorithm was used to implement it.

## Viki's Analytics infrastructure

Next, Huy from Viki presented how they create a pipeline for doing analytics at Viki, from sourcing events from database, getting real-time events from clients to processing and putting the into a usable dashboard.
