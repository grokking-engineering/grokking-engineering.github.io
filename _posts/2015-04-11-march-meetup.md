On March, we had one talk from Binh (Anduin Transactions) about implementing service-oriented architecture and Steven on building an artificial Neural Network. These examples came straight out from their companies, and while hard to grasp at first, provided interesting references to how other people are creating software.

## Building a service oriented architecture with Akka and Scala

We learn how Anduin Transactions created the infrastructure (programming language, framework, deployment, monitoring tools, etc) to enable their startup to move fast while dealing with strict constraint of the financial world. The talk aslo offer some glimpse on working with Actor model

## Creating artificial neural network

Steven went hands on with us on how they use neural network to extract contents from websites, instead of doing plain-old HTML parsing. It was an interesting notion, since machine learning might enable them to extract important content from any website without elaborate crawling and parsing
