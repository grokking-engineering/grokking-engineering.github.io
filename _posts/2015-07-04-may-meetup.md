In May, we tried a new format for our talks and got a great response from the community. People started to discuss more, especially during the pop-quiz we have prepared. At the same time, we also organized a small coding challenge to make things more interesting.

Besides all this, we had 2 talks:

## Migrating to service-oriented architecture at LOZI

### Speaker: Nguyen Thanh Trung
- Studied at FPT University
- CTO/Co-founder of LOZI, full-stack developer

Lozi.vn is a food discovery service for Vietnamese. In this talk, Trung presented their technical journey that:

- How KVM/Xen/Docker make migration process easier

## Building Real-time Data Pipeline at FPT
