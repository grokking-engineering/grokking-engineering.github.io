Grokking Engineering aims to build a community of good developers in VietNam with sustainable activities like talks, workshops, internship programs. We really appreciate every little bit of contribution to make this a reality.

Specifically, we are looking for:

## Sponsors

If your company/organization would like to support us in term of venue, food and drink or via other means, please drop us an email.

## Speakers

We are also looking for speakers for our talks (once every two months in 2015). If you want to speak or know someone who can, drop us an email, too.
