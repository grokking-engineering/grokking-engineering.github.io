# What is "Grok"?

- `Thou art god, I am god. All that groks is god` - Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land
- `When you claim to 'grok' some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your identity` - The Jargon File
