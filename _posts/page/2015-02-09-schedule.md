Being software engineers, we realized that the hard part in software development is not typing the code, but making choices: how does the architecture will be, what programming languges fits the job, what database should be used, how many machines do you need, etc. To make well-informed choices, software engineers need to understand techonlogies they use, get over the hype and really answer "Why should/shouldn't this work"?

Thus, in 2015, we started Grokking Engineering talks, where experts share these insight in context of systems they have built. Discussion topics include emerging languages, concurrent and distributed systems, new database, real system architecture, etc. No thing is really off-limit, as we strike to become T-shaped programmers.
