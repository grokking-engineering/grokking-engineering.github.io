Being software engineers, we realized that the hard part in software development is not typing the code, but making choices: how does the architecture will be, what programming languges fits the job, what database should be used, how many machines do you need, etc. To make well-informed choices, software engineers need to understand techonlogies they use, get over the hype and really answer "Why should/shouldn't this work"?

Thus, in 2015, we started Grokking Engineering talks, where experts share these insight in context of systems they have built. Discussion topics include emerging languages, concurrent and distributed systems, new database, real system architecture, etc. No thing is really off-limit, as we strike to become T-shaped programmers.

# Upcoming talk

> To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of stuff - Thomas Edison

This March, we are explore how to build big things from small components. Thus Grokking Engineering team proudly presents:

### Building microservices web application using Akka & Scala

#### [Binh Nguyen - Anduin Transactions](#)

Binh will briefly describe his company's web application, then explain why they pick mircroservices architecture and Akka & Scala ecosystem.
He will talk about both the pros and cons of the pick in comparison with the alternatives. No technical background of Scala is required but knowledge of at least one programming language will be helpful.

#### about Binh

Binh Nguyen is a software engineer at Anduin Transactions, a 5 months old financial technology company founded in San Francisco with engineering office in HCMC, Vietnam. Previously, Binh was an engineer at Palantir Technologies. Binh holds a PhD in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a bachelor degree, also in computer science, from University of Technology of HCMC.

### A journey with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in solving real-world problems

#### Steven Goh - Nubela Corp

We (at Nubela Corp) believe that machine learning, specifically in the branch of artificial neural-networks (ANN), will solve a lot of human-level problems as a blackbox trained by data-in-scale. And we will like to be the ones to create this technology that will eventually replace non-ML programmers.

#### about Steven

Steven Goh is a programmer, who founded of Nubela Corp as a developer-centric company built off the organic growth of his side-projects.
You might know him from Nubela Corp's products: Javelin Browser ([javelinbrowser.com](http://getgom.com/)) and Gom VPN ([getgom.com](http://getgom.com/))
