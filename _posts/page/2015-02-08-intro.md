Join Grokking Engineering, a community of developers who drill past technology hypes, and find yourself fundamental, rock-solid CS / software engineering gems.

Our tools are questions like "What does Ruby/Golang/Java Garbage Collectors do and why it matters?", "How PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j differs and where each of them work best?", "Which technologies/languages best fit my job?". And we will dig deep for answers.

Meet us on March 21, 2015 to see continuous deployment is done and Anduin Transaction and how neural network is being applied at Javelin
