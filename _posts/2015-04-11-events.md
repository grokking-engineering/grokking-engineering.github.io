    Grokking Engineering #2 - March
  </a>
</h2>

On March, we had one talk from Binh (Anduin Transactions) about implementing service-oriented architecture and Steven on building an artificial Neural Network. These examples came straight out from their companies, and while it is hard to grasp at first, they provided interesting references to how other people are building software.
