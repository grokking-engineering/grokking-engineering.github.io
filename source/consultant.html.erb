          <h3>Why this project?</h3>
          <p>
            Being founded for 2 years with 18+ events organized and lots of interaction with engineers, start-ups, business 
            in Ho Chi Minh City, we observed that there are more and more start-ups in many fields, whose founders are non-tech 
            having a hard time building their products. </p>
            
            <p>Being a non-tech founder themselves, they may encounter many problems: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Their developers are young and 
                  don't have enough experiences to solve some architect-level problem.</li>
                <li>The team is using wrong stacks which has some 
                    limitation to their business use case.</li>
                <li>The business' growth is too fast, and the team don't have experiences to 
                  handle the system's scaling, ...</li>
                <li>...</li>
              </ol>

          <p>
            Positioning ourselves as the platform for Software Engineer in Vietnam, 
            we would like to give some helps in solving these problems.
